        Let's continue to explore on how Travis solved his problems at work ðŸ’¡

## Travis Umbrella Thinks Differently
### Check What You Have
Let's take a look at the data that Travis is able to gather before starting to compile everything. He currently has a copy of staff data, checklist data (contains abbreviations references used firm wide) and the raw data from the stock markets. 

*Note: The below list shows only a portion of the data*

=== "Staff Data"

    LAN ID | Name | Email | Department
    :-- | -- | --| --:

Here is an overview of the raw data.[^1] he collects from the stock markets:

### Identify The Pattern
Travis is quick to find patterns in his collected raw data, he noticed that although there are empty cells about the staff name, department and department code, the staff ID is always recorded whenever transaction is performed. Of course, with the staff data on his hand, he can then learn about the stock that the staff used. 

Moreover, although staff data does not tell him about the department code, but it does tell him the staff department name where he can then make reference to his checklist data for the department code. Well, he can also reference the `cube` code on his checklist for the name of the code.

### Solution
He formulates a plan for his reporting workflows and this algorithm is able to process a majority of his datasets:

```mermaid
---
title: Algorithm1
---
    flowchart TD
    subgraph LOOP
        subgraph for_each_file
        direction TB
        A[Match stock market data IDs with staff data IDs] --> B[Conditional Filtering]
        B[Conditional Filtering] --> C[Update the staff name and department]
        C[Update the staff name and department] --> D[Match Department with Department Code]
        D[Match Department with Department Code] --> E[Match Cube with Cube Name]
        end
    end

```

But there are still some datasets that still not able to process by his program, so Travis decides to devise a separate algorithm for some non-routine datasets.

## Some Worse Case
!!! warning
    Real world data does not appear to be that clean, let's take a look at some non-routine cases

### Inconsistent Data Entry
Travis noticed that on one of the data he collected from `HKSE` the name of the staff does not match with the company staff directory, for example "Muhamad Ali bin Abu" is named as "Muhamad Ali Abu"; "Lucas Den Shi Ki" is named as "Lucas Shi Ki Den". And in the dataset, there is no IDs column and only name column:

=== "HKSE"
    Name |
    :-- |
    Den Shi Ki Lucas |
    Muhamad Ali Abu |
    Jef A_DriaN |

=== "Actual Name"
    Name |
    :-- |
    Lucas Shi Ki Den |
    Muhamad Ali  bin Abu |
    Jef Adrian |

To resolve this, he has to rely on a metric, called the [Levinshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) ratio that computes the difference between two sequences. Generally if two sequences are exactly the same, the Levinshtein ratio will be 100 and when they gradually differ more in terms of arrangement and alphabets the ratio will decrease. 

What he will do then is he will match all the names in the staff data against the similar names, if the Levinshtein ratio is higher than 90, then the similar names will be replaced with the names in the staff data.

```mermaid
---
title: Algorithm2
---
    flowchart TD
    subgraph LOOP
        subgraph for_each_staff_name
        direction TB
        A[Compute Levinshtein ratio against all other names] --> B[Update other names if ratio > 90]
        end
    end
    B[Update other names if ratio > 90] --"when_done"--> C[Back to Algorithm1 but with name matching to update IDs]

```

## Finalizing Report

### Time For Export
With all the data being cleaned and labelled, Travis can now start to prepare for his reports. Since all the data are stored as one dataset, he would need to export it as individual Excel files for each stock category:

```mermaid
---
title: Algorithm3
---
    flowchart TD
    subgraph LOOP
    A[Filter by department] --> B[Filtered data with one department]
    B[Filtered data with one department] --> C[Export to Excel]
    end

```

Now Travis gets all the files he wants, but these files are raw, he'll use VBA to add some formatting to them so that they look nice before submitting to his boss. The good news is he don't really need to do a loop to apply the macros he wrote because the macro can run on the entire specify folder:

```mermaid
---
title: Algorithm4
---
    flowchart TD
    A[Get folder that stores all the Excel files] --> B[Apply macros for each file]

```

### The Output
Here is the output that Travis will get for each of his stock category:

    That's the end for the interesting story with Travis. Check out the next page and see the functions that powered Travis' workflows.
