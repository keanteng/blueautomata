### Identify The Pattern
Travis is quick to find patterns in his collected raw data, he noticed that although there are empty cells about the staff name, department and department code, the staff ID is always recorded whenever transaction is performed. Of course, with the staff data on his hand, he can then learn about the stock that the staff used. 

Moreover, although staff data does not tell him about the department code, but it does tell him the staff department name where he can then make reference to his checklist data for the department code. Well, he can also reference the `cube` code on his checklist for the name of the code.
