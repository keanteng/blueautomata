# A Case Study

!!! info
    Let's read a story.[^1] to see how this package is inspired ðŸ”¥


### Getting a New Job
In the year 2055, a guy named Travis Umbrella.[^2] become the Manager of LightSpeed Investment under the Department of Data Management. At that time, Travis is in his forties, and he studies Economics back in college. Previously, he works as the Manager under the Department of Investment. Well, he is an adventurous person and dare to try something new, so when opportunities come, he decided to advance in the field of managing data to get some new perspective in his work. 

In fact, Travis works in a weird company where the company makes investment in a weird way but with a high return. The company gives stocks to the employee so that they can sell in stock markets. around the world.[^3] 

For each employee, they can only receive one type of stock like Google `GOOG`, but they are allowed to sell in a few markets such as New York Stock Exchange `NYSE` and Hong Kong Stock Exchange `HKSE`. Travis does not concern with whether the employee can make money or not or how many stocks each employee received since it is not part of his job.

Every month, Travis needs to submit a report for auditing where he needs to track down the employees stock holding type and the market that they sell their stock. Well, LightSpeed Investment is a fast-moving company, where employees come and go. So at the end of the month when Travis submits his report he has to make sure that employees that resigned should not be included in his report.

### Time For Action
For Travis to complete his report he would first need to get hold of the stocks' data that are traded by the firms' employees in worldwide stock markets. He then stored the transactions record for each stock market in an individual file. Since there is no well-build system for the data collection, each of the file looks different, some contains more columns than the other, some with missing information such as employees' name and some even contains wrong employee IDs and outdated information. 

Travis realizes that he would need some other data to validate his collected data, so he reached out to his friend, James Claude Diamond from the Fake Human Resources Department to get the latest copy of the staff data where it contains the staff's assigned stocks and stock market that they can sell their stock. He also compiles a copy of checklist data by himself to match up the stock code and stock market code to their respective stock name and stock market name.

### Think Different
Travis is good at math and logical thinking, so he knows for resigned employees their names will not be in the staff dataset. In fact, what he will do is he will match the staff ID from the stock market data he collected with the staff data to obtain information as follows:

- The staff's name
- The staff's assigned stock
- The staff's status (resigned or not)
- The staff's cube.[^4]

That approach, allows him to work quickly to compile the data he collects from the stock markets, what he will do then, is to create files for each stock category to see where they are traded around the world - of course with a nice looking template before submitting for audit review after the quarter ends!
